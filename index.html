			<h3>Ahoy!</h3>
			
			<p>Welcome to my little website. Glad you decided to stop by.</p>
			
			<p>I’ve had my hands in a lot of different pies over the years—digital magazine editing, indie bookselling, and philanthropy among them—but nowadays, I mostly split my time between being a candidate for an MFA in Fiction at the Bennington Writing Seminars and freelance writing and editing. When I’m not reading and writing like a motherfucker (as Cheryl Strayed <a href="http://therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/">so wisely advises</a>), I’m focused on <a href="http://midnightbreakfast.com/">Midnight Breakfast</a>, a literary magazine I co-founded and became Editor-in-Chief of in 2014. Just last year, <a href="https://www.thebillfold.com/2016/05/the-cost-of-running-a-literary-magazine/">The Billfold interviewed us</a> about the inner-workings of that process, how we build community through readership, and what it means to pay folks for their work in this day and age.</p>
			
			<p>Forever voracious, I’m always on the lookout for eclectic and challenging new projects and collaborators, so if what you see below grabs you, please feel free to <a href="mailto:rebecca.r.rubenstein@gmail.com">drop me a line</a>. Though I primarily lean towards making words work and literary assignments, helping people effectively communicate their ideas through mindful content strategy is also an interest.</p> 

			<p>I currently live in San Francisco, and spend my off-hours cooking (and ogling food porn on Instagram), drinking copious amounts of tea, and playing far too much Scrabble, Two Dots, and 1010!. I also have an M. Phil. in Film History and Theory from Trinity College Dublin, which I put to good use by winning Oscar betting pools each year.</p>
